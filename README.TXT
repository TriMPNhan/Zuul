To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.

This project was written as the starting point of a small Java project.

The goal is to extend the game:

  - add items to rooms (items may have weight)
  - add multiple players
  - add commands (pick, drop, examine, read, ...)
  - (anything you can think of, really...)

Read chapter 7 of the book to get a detailed description of the project.
